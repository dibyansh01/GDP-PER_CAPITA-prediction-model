# **GDP-PER_CAPITA-Prediction-Model**
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of our country. By leveraging historical GDP, Per Capita and Growth% data with its features, the model will provide forecasts of future GDP & Per Capita values.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time series analysis techniques, such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, have proven to be effective in forecasting economic variables. In this context, this project aims to develop an ARIMA-based time series model for predicting GDP</li>
  <li>The ARIMA model is a widely used approach for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It captures the sequential dependencies and trends present in the data by considering three key components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).</li>
  <li>The AR component models the linear relationship between past observations and the current observation, while the MA component accounts for the influence of past errors on the current value. The differencing step helps in removing any underlying trends or seasonality, making the time series stationary and suitable for modeling.</li> 
<li>The ARIMA model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends makes it a suitable choice for GDP forecasting, where a balance between capturing immediate variations and understanding broader economic cycles is crucial.</li>

<li>You can customize this project as per your imagination and let others know the beauty of your imagination.</li>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In summary,This ARIMA-based GDP prediction model with low residue skew, residue mean close to zero, and P-values near zero indicates a reliable and accurate forecasting model. These measures provide evidence that the model is effectively capturing the temporal patterns and dependencies in the GDP data, producing unbiased predictions centered around the actual values</li>
